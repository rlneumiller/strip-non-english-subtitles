1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Subtitties by TeddyCat!

2
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,235
Max!

3
00:02:25,906 --> 00:02:27,324
Come on!

4
00:02:27,491 --> 00:02:30,161
Don't keep the Sisters waiting.

5
00:02:34,957 --> 00:02:37,334
This is Frey.

6
00:02:38,335 --> 00:02:41,380
She's new here as well.

7
00:02:46,677 --> 00:02:48,053
Can you read?

8
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:56,854
It's a giraffe. They were from Africa.

9
00:02:57,146 --> 00:02:59,190
- You can read? - Yes.

10
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:10,075
"There are many robot servants, and they serve you all day.

11
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:14,371
If you live there, you never get sick or old."

12
00:03:14,538 --> 00:03:17,541
- I'll take us there one day. - Really?

13
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,043
Yeah, I promise.

14
00:03:19,794 --> 00:03:21,545
Frey and...

15
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,799
Max...

16
00:03:25,591 --> 00:03:27,259
forever.

17
00:03:29,136 --> 00:03:32,306
Max, have you been stealing things again?

18
00:03:34,391 --> 00:03:38,646
It breaks my heart. Why do you do this?

19
00:03:39,563 --> 00:03:41,232
So you can save up?

20
00:03:41,398 --> 00:03:44,568
One day buy a ticket up to that place?

21
00:03:56,747 --> 00:04:00,209
That place is not for you, or for me.

22
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,295
But it's not fair, Sister.

23
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:05,089
Why can't I go there?

24
00:04:05,256 --> 00:04:07,258
Sometimes in life we don't understand...

25
00:04:07,424 --> 00:04:09,927
why things are the way they are.

26
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:13,389
But I know one thing.

27
00:04:13,848 --> 00:04:16,100
I know you are special.

28
00:04:17,017 --> 00:04:20,271
You will do something very important one day.

29
00:04:20,604 --> 00:04:22,731
Something you were born for.

30
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:26,110
My little Max.

31
00:05:10,738 --> 00:05:14,867
Off to work, huh? Gotta get up early to work that line.

32
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,161
Make the world a better place.

33
00:05:17,328 --> 00:05:19,747
That's real funny, I have a job.

34
00:05:24,335 --> 00:05:27,379
Come on. You think I got money? Do I look like I have money?

35
00:05:27,546 --> 00:05:29,590
Come on.

36
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,675
How about you? You got a little money?

37
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:34,845
Come on. What have you got in there? What have you got?

38
00:05:35,012 --> 00:05:36,263
Oh, wait a minute.

39
00:05:36,764 --> 00:05:37,806
Wait a minute.

40
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:43,103
Oh, it's 5 bucks. Hey, wait a minute, I got 5 bucks. I'm rich.

41
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,607
I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium.

42
00:05:47,274 --> 00:05:48,359
All right.

43
00:05:57,701 --> 00:06:02,039
Please form an orderly queue. Your bus has arrived.

44
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:11,256
Leave me alone!

45
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:13,926
Checked. Move on.

46
00:06:14,218 --> 00:06:16,929
Your bags may be searched.

47
00:06:22,309 --> 00:06:23,769
Good morning, officer.

48
00:06:23,936 --> 00:06:29,066
Extensive criminal history. Multiple felonies. What's in the bag?

49
00:06:29,817 --> 00:06:32,152
Hair products, mostly.

50
00:06:32,653 --> 00:06:34,571
I'm just fucking with... Hey, hey, hey.

51
00:06:34,738 --> 00:06:37,157
I'm just going to work. Nothing's in the fucking bag.

52
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:38,409
Come on, I...

53
00:06:40,744 --> 00:06:43,080
I'm just going to work, man. Come on.

54
00:06:49,503 --> 00:06:51,255
- Checked. - Nothing in there, is there?

55
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,632
Zero tolerance policy applies to all Citizens.

56
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:55,050
No shit.

57
00:06:55,217 --> 00:07:01,015
You must report immediately to your parole officer. Thank you, Citizen.

58
00:07:01,181 --> 00:07:02,433
No, thank you.

59
00:07:13,027 --> 00:07:17,281
- Frey, fracture, Bed 2. - Just let us work, okay? Let us work.

60
00:07:22,703 --> 00:07:24,329
Max?

61
00:07:25,372 --> 00:07:28,375
Frey. I thought you were...

62
00:07:30,461 --> 00:07:32,963
Been back for a while. I see things haven't changed.

63
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:36,008
- Ah, No, this wasn't even my fault. - Of course not.

64
00:07:36,508 --> 00:07:39,219
- Let me have a look. Pretty bad break. - It isn't pleasant.

65
00:07:44,224 --> 00:07:45,476
Yeah.

66
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,020
That's... That's great.

67
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:50,481
You still stealing cars?

68
00:07:50,647 --> 00:07:53,984
No. God, no. I don't do any of that stupid shit anymore.

69
00:07:54,151 --> 00:07:55,486
I work at Armadyne.

70
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,364
- On the line, working my way up. - They need you on the third floor.

71
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:00,657
Be right there.

72
00:08:00,824 --> 00:08:02,826
So, you know, now that you're back...

73
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:05,996
Just a second, Max. Two seconds.

74
00:08:06,163 --> 00:08:08,582
Dominica. Can you take over here?

75
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,835
Hey, listen. Now, you know, because you're back and everything...

76
00:08:12,002 --> 00:08:13,670
Max, I'm so sorry. I have to go.

77
00:08:13,837 --> 00:08:16,090
It's good to see you. Stay out of trouble.

78
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,343
I do.

79
00:08:23,472 --> 00:08:25,474
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.

80
00:08:25,641 --> 00:08:27,768
Dr. Rodriguez, call the OR.

81
00:08:27,935 --> 00:08:31,188
- Out of the way, sir. - Look, I-I get it.

82
00:08:31,355 --> 00:08:33,732
I know... I know why you left the neighborhood. I understand.

83
00:08:33,732 --> 00:08:34,775
But

84
00:08:34,775 --> 00:08:39,613
If I was as smart as you, I would have left too. Have dinner with me. Just...

85
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,574
All right. Look, I'll settle for a coffee.

86
00:08:43,283 --> 00:08:45,244
- No. - Oh, Jesus.

87
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:47,538
I gotta break my other arm to get attention?

88
00:08:47,704 --> 00:08:49,540
- Stop. Stop. - Because I will do that.

89
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,793
My life is complicated, Max.

90
00:08:58,966 --> 00:09:02,136
- My shift ends at 8 on Wednesday, okay? - Yeah. All right.

91
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,263
- Coffee. - Yeah, coffee. Right.

92
00:09:04,429 --> 00:09:06,598
Get out of here.

93
00:09:17,985 --> 00:09:19,153
Hello.

94
00:09:19,153 --> 00:09:20,237
Uh...

95
00:09:20,237 --> 00:09:21,738
Before we start, I'd just like to explain...

96
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:26,118
Max Da Costa. Violation of Penal Code 2219 today at Bus Stop 34B.

97
00:09:26,285 --> 00:09:28,579
Yes, that's exactly what I wanted to talk to you about.

98
00:09:28,745 --> 00:09:30,414
See, there was a misunderstanding.

99
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,708
Immediate extension of parole by farther eight months.

100
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:35,752
Wait, what? No, no, no. No, no. I can explain what happened.

101
00:09:38,088 --> 00:09:42,342
Stop talking. Police officers noted violent and antisocial behavior.

102
00:09:42,593 --> 00:09:44,595
We regretfully must extend parole.

103
00:09:46,263 --> 00:09:49,474
Elevation in heart rate detected. Would you like a pill?

104
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:53,145
No. Thank you.

105
00:09:55,397 --> 00:09:58,775
Personality matrix suggests a 78.3 percent chance of regression...

106
00:09:58,942 --> 00:10:01,153
to old behavior patterns: Grand theft auto.

107
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,488
Assault with a deadly weapon. Resisting arrest.

108
00:10:04,031 --> 00:10:08,368
- Would you like to talk to a human? - No, I am okay, thank you.

109
00:10:08,535 --> 00:10:11,622
- Are you being sarcastic and/or abusive? - Negative.

110
00:10:11,788 --> 00:10:14,249
It is a federal offense to abuse a parole officer.

111
00:10:14,416 --> 00:10:15,417
Understood.

112
00:10:18,795 --> 00:10:21,048
Safety is our priority.

113
00:10:21,548 --> 00:10:24,301
- Hey. Da Costa. - No Weapons detected.

114
00:10:24,468 --> 00:10:26,637
- You're late for your shift. - Yeah man, I had a little thing so...

115
00:10:26,803 --> 00:10:28,972
Ohm, no, no, no, no. you can't work with that. You're out.

116
00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:32,976
No, no, no, no. I'm good, man. I can work. I can work. This is-it's not, This comes off later today. I'm fine. - So you're good?

117
00:10:36,563 --> 00:10:39,149
- Yeah, all right. - You know, You're lucky to have this job.

118
00:10:39,316 --> 00:10:42,194
No Weapons detected. You are clear for entry.

119
00:10:42,694 --> 00:10:47,157
the restroom more than once per shift. Please keep your Workstation tidy.

120
00:10:47,324 --> 00:10:50,869
A tidy Workstation is an efficient Workstation.

121
00:11:03,757 --> 00:11:05,759
Hey, Check it out, man. I think he likes you.

122
00:11:05,926 --> 00:11:08,178
Think he got his face peel today? He looks good.

123
00:11:08,345 --> 00:11:11,265
Attention. All workers must reach weekly quotas.

124
00:11:11,431 --> 00:11:14,434
Please report any unsafe activity to your supervisor.

125
00:11:14,643 --> 00:11:17,020
If we don't have a clear path to upside...

126
00:11:17,187 --> 00:11:20,440
our investors are going to start losing a lot of confidence.

127
00:11:20,607 --> 00:11:22,818
What do you think I've been doing down on Earth?

128
00:11:22,985 --> 00:11:25,529
- You think I enjoy breathing this air? - No, of course...

129
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:29,866
I am doing everything possible to restore profitability to this company.

130
00:11:30,033 --> 00:11:31,910
The company that I built.

131
00:11:32,077 --> 00:11:33,453
Now, if you will excuse me...

132
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,456
I have to not speak to you people any longer. Thank you.

133
00:11:47,634 --> 00:11:49,386
Closing 34.

134
00:11:53,307 --> 00:11:54,599
Fire in 34.

135
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,707
Burn her ID!

136
00:12:34,514 --> 00:12:36,600
We hacked three transponder codes, Spider.

137
00:12:36,767 --> 00:12:38,310
Okay. Pull them up on-screen.

138
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:40,354
Codes have been accepted.

139
00:12:41,521 --> 00:12:42,939
Fire up the shuttles!

140
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:45,901
We are going UP!

141
00:13:21,645 --> 00:13:23,980
- Take a look at the garden. - We will. Thank you.

142
00:13:24,147 --> 00:13:26,316
Yes, I understand...

143
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:30,237
My, how you've grown!

144
00:13:31,238 --> 00:13:32,739
Are the children here?

145
00:13:32,906 --> 00:13:34,241
Yes, with Dominica.

146
00:13:34,741 --> 00:13:36,785
I have a present for you.

147
00:13:37,953 --> 00:13:39,788
Go and get it with your mother.

148
00:13:39,955 --> 00:13:41,832
It's next to the couch.

149
00:13:42,332 --> 00:13:44,960
Ma'am, would you care for a refreshment?

150
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:46,253
Command: Cancel.

151
00:14:05,897 --> 00:14:07,399
Sorry for disturbing you, ma'm.

152
00:14:07,566 --> 00:14:09,860
We have a number of undocumented ships inbound.

153
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,867
Good afternoon, Defense Secretary Delacourt.

154
00:14:17,409 --> 00:14:21,413
Three undocumented ships are approaching Elysium airspace.

155
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:25,208
Emergency orders six and seven are now in effect.

156
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:30,881
Protocol 22B-39 in progress.

157
00:14:36,303 --> 00:14:38,430
Attention, incoming vessels.

158
00:14:38,597 --> 00:14:43,059
You have made unauthorized entry into Elysium airspace.

159
00:14:43,226 --> 00:14:47,105
Return to Earth or we will be forced to take immediate action.

160
00:14:47,272 --> 00:14:50,150
You are in Violation of Elysium airspace.

161
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:51,985
The standard warning didn't work.

162
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:56,364
Fifteen thousand kilometers and Closing.

163
00:14:56,823 --> 00:14:59,618
- What do you want us to do, ma'am? - Activate Kruger.

164
00:15:01,244 --> 00:15:03,163
Ma'am, according to Executive Order 355...

165
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:05,665
we are unauthorized to use our assets on Earth.

166
00:15:05,832 --> 00:15:07,918
I am authorizing you.

167
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:10,462
Yes, ma'am.

168
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:29,773
Agent 32 Alpha, we are sending a packet. Over.

169
00:15:46,206 --> 00:15:48,458
Ten thousand kilometers and Closing.

170
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:50,168
Sending coordinates to asset.

171
00:15:50,335 --> 00:15:51,962
Syncing target data.

172
00:15:54,214 --> 00:15:55,632
Shoot them down.

173
00:16:04,015 --> 00:16:05,183
Missiles away.

174
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:52,188
Two ships destroyed. Forty-six total casualties.

175
00:16:52,355 --> 00:16:53,857
Impact in five...

176
00:17:01,364 --> 00:17:03,283
- The last missile was a miss. - Ridiculous.

177
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,619
Only one made it.

178
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:10,790
Ma'm The ship has breached our atmosphere.

179
00:17:25,138 --> 00:17:27,390
First undocumented ship just touched down.

180
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:30,644
I want everyone coming out of that vehicle apprehended.

181
00:18:00,006 --> 00:18:01,257
Identification confirmed.

182
00:18:03,093 --> 00:18:04,427
Scanning.

183
00:18:06,179 --> 00:18:08,848
Reconstruction process initiated.

184
00:18:13,478 --> 00:18:14,938
No.

185
00:18:16,314 --> 00:18:20,485
We have 32 arrests, 13 casualties and two illegals still at large, ma'am.

186
00:18:35,709 --> 00:18:39,170
You are under arrest under the 68-C Immigration Act.

187
00:18:42,048 --> 00:18:44,759
- All illegals are now in custody, ma'am. - Yes.

188
00:18:44,926 --> 00:18:47,971
Send them to Deportation. Get them off this habitat.

189
00:18:59,899 --> 00:19:04,154
Secretary Delacourt, please report to President Patel immediately.

190
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,741
Secretary Delacourt, report to President Patel.

191
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,517
What up, man?

192
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:36,144
What happened?

193
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,521
- The police. - You okay?

194
00:19:38,688 --> 00:19:40,023
Yeah. Don't worry about it.

195
00:19:44,986 --> 00:19:48,198
- You didn't hear what I was gonna say. - All right. Go ahead. Go ahead.

196
00:19:48,364 --> 00:19:51,493
Okay. You know the house of Los Zetas, up on the hill?

197
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,246
- Yeah, the one with all the guns. - Yeah. They have five cars. New ones.

198
00:19:55,413 --> 00:19:58,374
It's gonna be three of us. Tomorrow at lunch.

199
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:01,002
- Lunch time. That's the plan? - Yeah.

200
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:03,213
- Jesus Christ. - What? You have a better plan?

201
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:07,300
Yeah. We just take one guy, go before the sun comes up.

202
00:20:07,467 --> 00:20:10,887
You take the two fastest cars, torch the batteries on the other one so...

203
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:12,722
Fuck you, fuck you.

204
00:20:12,889 --> 00:20:16,518
I got you. Oh, please man, you're the best. Give me one year.

205
00:20:16,684 --> 00:20:18,770
- Just one year. - I'm not going back to prison, man.

206
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:20,438
One year, please.

207
00:20:20,605 --> 00:20:23,566
Look at you. You used to be a legend, and now what?

208
00:20:34,953 --> 00:20:37,622
The time is 5:50 a.m.

209
00:20:48,049 --> 00:20:51,511
No weapons detected. You are clear for entry.

210
00:20:56,766 --> 00:20:59,352
Closing 34.

211
00:21:17,787 --> 00:21:20,832
Hey. You're holding up the line.

212
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,296
Attention. Workers may not visit the restroom more than once per shift.

213
00:21:26,462 --> 00:21:29,465
- What have you done, Da Costa? - No, I'm just trying to reset.

214
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:35,013
- Oj, the pallet's pinched. - Yeah, it moved.

215
00:21:35,179 --> 00:21:37,390
- Just go in there. - No. I mean...

216
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:41,185
Look, either you go in there right now or I'll find someone who will...

217
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:43,605
- ...and you can clean out your locker. - Come on.

218
00:21:43,771 --> 00:21:46,608
No no. That's the deal, okay? In you go.

219
00:21:50,612 --> 00:21:52,822
Let's go, people. Back to work.

220
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:56,409
Fuck.

221
00:22:20,183 --> 00:22:21,851
No, no. No, no, no!

222
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:25,647
Hey! Hey! Hey!

223
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,868
Hey!

224
00:22:44,248 --> 00:22:46,250
Hey, come on, you guys.

225
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,046
It's too late. It's too late, come on.

226
00:22:50,254 --> 00:22:51,589
Come on.

227
00:22:51,923 --> 00:22:53,967
Extraction!

228
00:23:23,079 --> 00:23:26,040
They started the fight, Sister.

229
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:29,293
I just want to live there.

230
00:23:31,504 --> 00:23:34,132
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?

231
00:23:35,425 --> 00:23:36,926
Yes.

232
00:23:39,053 --> 00:23:40,096
Well...

233
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,641
Now look how beautiful we look from there.

234
00:23:46,185 --> 00:23:47,228
Keep it.

235
00:23:48,062 --> 00:23:49,772
This is yours now.

236
00:23:50,606 --> 00:23:54,277
To never forget about where you come from.

237
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:13,629
What happened?

238
00:24:13,796 --> 00:24:17,300
You have been exposed to a lethal dose of radiation.

239
00:24:17,467 --> 00:24:20,303
You will experience catastrophic organ failure.

240
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:23,389
In five days' time, you will die.

241
00:24:33,691 --> 00:24:36,694
What is going on? Why has production stopped?

242
00:24:37,111 --> 00:24:40,281
- He's been exposed. - No. Don't breathe on me. Cover your mouth.

243
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,491
I'm sorry, sir.

244
00:24:50,666 --> 00:24:53,836
Does his skin fall off or something?

245
00:24:54,003 --> 00:24:56,422
I don't want to replace the bedding in there. Just get him out.

246
00:24:56,756 --> 00:24:59,008
- Yes, sir. - Great. Thank you.

247
00:24:59,175 --> 00:25:02,512
Mr. Carlyle, your shuttle is ready for departure.

248
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,479
Please sign this to receive medication.

249
00:25:19,362 --> 00:25:24,826
Miporol, extremely potent, will keep you functioning normally until your death.

250
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:30,206
Please take one pill with each meal. Thank you for your service.

251
00:25:41,425 --> 00:25:46,889
At 1500 hours yesterday, you shot down two shuttles, killing 46 civilians.

252
00:25:47,056 --> 00:25:49,559
Your mandate is to deal with illegals quietly.

253
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:51,310
I am aware of that.

254
00:25:51,727 --> 00:25:53,563
And then there's the use of this...

255
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:02,405
Fifteen human rights violations. Rapes. Kidnappings. Torture.

256
00:26:02,572 --> 00:26:05,575
The man's been diagnosed with serious psychological issues.

257
00:26:05,741 --> 00:26:07,743
We made it explicitly clear to you...

258
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:10,288
that we are no longer using sleeper agents.

259
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:13,249
Tell me something, President Patel.

260
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:15,668
Do you have children?

261
00:26:17,837 --> 00:26:19,589
I am not the one being reviewed here.

262
00:26:20,882 --> 00:26:23,301
Then I will assume you do not.

263
00:26:23,467 --> 00:26:28,222
Perhaps if you did have children, then you would behave in a manner...

264
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:32,143
that is more conducive to the longevity of this habitat.

265
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:37,023
I understand that it is not the fashion to think and to act as I do.

266
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,942
I understand that perfectly.

267
00:26:40,109 --> 00:26:44,614
But when they come for your house, for the house you built for your children...

268
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,782
and your children's children...

269
00:26:46,949 --> 00:26:52,538
it won't be PR and campaign promises that keep them out. It will be me.

270
00:26:52,705 --> 00:26:55,458
I've heard enough. This is your final warning.

271
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:59,462
Any further unauthorized actions, and you will be removed from office.

272
00:26:59,629 --> 00:27:03,883
And let's discharge this Agent Kruger permanently.

273
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,551
All in favor?

274
00:27:07,053 --> 00:27:08,971
Good. Effective immediately.

275
00:27:29,033 --> 00:27:30,785
You want some beer?

276
00:27:40,127 --> 00:27:42,672
You have been discharged from CCB.

277
00:27:42,838 --> 00:27:45,716
Please return all weapons to the local embassy.

278
00:27:47,551 --> 00:27:50,513
Fuck your politics, man! Fuck you!

279
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:06,988
Max.

280
00:28:11,117 --> 00:28:12,368
Max.

281
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,415
What happened? Jesus. Let me help you.

282
00:28:17,581 --> 00:28:18,791
Let's go in, come on.

283
00:28:21,252 --> 00:28:23,212
Max, what happened? Jesus.

284
00:28:23,379 --> 00:28:24,839
Max. What happened?

285
00:28:25,006 --> 00:28:27,591
- I shouldn't have gone in, man. - Go in where?

286
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:30,344
Jesus.

287
00:28:34,307 --> 00:28:36,392
I took a full dose, man.

288
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:38,811
I got a full dose.

289
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:49,822
They gave me Miporol, man.

290
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,283
They gave me fucking...

291
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,578
Miporol.

292
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:00,207
Five fucking days, man. I only got five days.

293
00:29:01,334 --> 00:29:02,376
You have to take this.

294
00:29:04,670 --> 00:29:08,007
- They can fix this shit on Elysium, man. - I know.

295
00:29:10,384 --> 00:29:13,095
Max. Max, take the pill.

296
00:29:18,017 --> 00:29:19,602
There you go.

297
00:29:20,603 --> 00:29:22,438
To see Spider, you need money.

298
00:29:23,773 --> 00:29:26,817
I'll give you everything I have, but it's not enough for a ticket.

299
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,446
He's gonna give me a ticket.

300
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,783
He's gonna give me a fucking ticket.

301
00:29:36,827 --> 00:29:39,538
Frey, we've done everything we could to help your daughter.

302
00:29:40,331 --> 00:29:43,667
I met with the board today and they recommend we send her home with you.

303
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:46,128
How can I work here and leave her at home?

304
00:29:46,295 --> 00:29:48,381
It can happen any minute, Dr. Faizel.

305
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:51,967
I know. I know. If she has another seizure, of course bring her back to the ward.

306
00:29:52,134 --> 00:29:53,469
Of course.

307
00:29:53,636 --> 00:29:55,346
But until then, she's discharged.

308
00:29:55,721 --> 00:29:59,141
This isn't Elysium. We can't just heal her.

309
00:30:42,226 --> 00:30:43,686
Max.

310
00:30:43,853 --> 00:30:46,063
It's been a while, my brother.

311
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,399
How's life at the factory?

312
00:30:49,525 --> 00:30:51,235
I need to ask you a favor.

313
00:30:51,402 --> 00:30:53,279
What? I-I can't hear you. What?

314
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:56,365
I need a ticket up there.

315
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:04,707
Ah...

316
00:31:04,707 --> 00:31:07,376
Absolutely. Do you prefer aisle or window?

317
00:31:07,543 --> 00:31:10,963
I'm being fucking serious, man.

318
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,425
Listen. I'm gonna come back. I'm gonna come back and work for you.

319
00:31:19,722 --> 00:31:21,223
You know what?

320
00:31:23,225 --> 00:31:26,479
This is priceless.

321
00:31:28,772 --> 00:31:31,984
This is priceless.

322
00:31:34,737 --> 00:31:39,200
Do you have - do you have any idea how many idiots come in here...

323
00:31:39,366 --> 00:31:41,744
saying the same kind of bullshit?

324
00:31:41,911 --> 00:31:45,456
I got little kids coming in here every day.

325
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:51,086
I'd get the fuck out of here right now.

326
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:58,260
I did three years for you. After everything I did for you, you'll get me up there.

327
00:31:58,427 --> 00:32:00,429
- Can you feel this? - Go ahead and shoot.

328
00:32:00,596 --> 00:32:04,308
I got so much radiation in my body right now, you're probably getting sick yourself.

329
00:32:04,475 --> 00:32:07,645
- You're really dying? - I'm fucking dying, motherfucker.

330
00:32:07,811 --> 00:32:11,982
See this? It's over. Put the gun down. Put the gun down!

331
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:14,235
Put the gun down! Get out of here!

332
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,779
Okay?

333
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:24,954
But no one here had the balls!

334
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:30,459
Max.

335
00:32:47,893 --> 00:32:49,812
All right, here we go.

336
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,235
This...

337
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,822
my friend...

338
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:03,909
This can be your ticket up there.

339
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:09,915
One last job for me, you earn your way up.

340
00:33:11,041 --> 00:33:15,796
- What is it? - Take an Elysian asshole, right?

341
00:33:15,963 --> 00:33:17,506
A billionaire.

342
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:20,467
He's down on Earth for some business.

343
00:33:20,634 --> 00:33:23,596
He's-he's-he's here for whatever. We hijack him.

344
00:33:23,762 --> 00:33:25,514
- Fuck that. - Okay, relax.

345
00:33:29,184 --> 00:33:32,605
Forget his watch. Forget his ride. Forget all that shit.

346
00:33:32,771 --> 00:33:36,191
This is what you take.

347
00:33:38,277 --> 00:33:41,864
Organic information, right out of his head.

348
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:46,827
Now, I'm talking about bank codes, passwords, log-in data.

349
00:33:46,994 --> 00:33:49,371
Access to billions.

350
00:33:50,289 --> 00:33:53,042
All you have to do is plug into his brain...

351
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:56,003
download the data into yours with this baby...

352
00:33:56,170 --> 00:33:58,130
and bring it to me.

353
00:33:58,297 --> 00:33:59,632
This is crazy, Max. Come on.

354
00:33:59,798 --> 00:34:05,262
Once we verify the data, I'll give you a one-way ride, all expenses paid.

355
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:08,223
Even throw in some snacks and a drink.

356
00:34:08,390 --> 00:34:12,519
All you have to do is walk into a house and use the med bay...

357
00:34:12,686 --> 00:34:13,729
and you're cured.

358
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:17,358
Sandro will do the surgery. You know him?

359
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:19,610
What the fuck? Jesus Christ.

360
00:34:19,777 --> 00:34:21,070
I'm good.

361
00:34:21,236 --> 00:34:26,325
Actually, you seem all weak a-a-a-and-and fucked up.

362
00:34:26,492 --> 00:34:30,579
So you know what? I-I-I'll have them...

363
00:34:30,746 --> 00:34:34,667
This is crazy. Let's get out of here, please. Listen to me.

364
00:34:34,833 --> 00:34:37,795
- What the fuck am I gonna do? - I'll have them install...

365
00:34:38,796 --> 00:34:42,049
this. A third-generation exo-suit.

366
00:34:42,216 --> 00:34:46,261
We hook this into your nervous system, it'll make you as strong as a droid.

367
00:34:46,428 --> 00:34:48,597
You're already under the knife, right?

368
00:34:48,764 --> 00:34:50,516
Let's get out of here. Please.

369
00:34:50,683 --> 00:34:52,935
I want a four-man team, but I pick them.

370
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:55,771
I'm sending my own data wrangler.

371
00:34:55,938 --> 00:34:59,983
- Brain-to-brain data is real tough. - Okay.

372
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:03,696
But I'm taking Julio. He gets a ticket up there, same as me.

373
00:35:03,862 --> 00:35:07,074
Yeah, sure. Okay. I'll go get the boys ready.

374
00:35:07,658 --> 00:35:08,951
Wait.

375
00:35:10,953 --> 00:35:12,454
It's gotta be John Carlyle.

376
00:35:13,997 --> 00:35:17,209
The CEO of Armadyne Carlyle?

377
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,962
That's the mark.

378
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:29,263
Secretary Delacourt, Mr. Carlyle has arrived.

379
00:35:29,638 --> 00:35:34,852
You are here to persuade me to renew our Armadyne contracts, yes?

380
00:35:35,018 --> 00:35:36,395
Astute as always.

381
00:35:37,646 --> 00:35:39,356
Come with me.

382
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:49,742
I'm not interested in your little ideas.

383
00:35:50,492 --> 00:35:53,036
I'm interested in something much larger.

384
00:35:53,203 --> 00:35:55,539
This habitat is dying.

385
00:35:55,706 --> 00:35:58,167
There is a political sickness inside of it.

386
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:01,086
A tumor that needs to be removed.

387
00:36:01,253 --> 00:36:04,757
You and your company are in need of revenue...

388
00:36:04,923 --> 00:36:06,508
that is drying up.

389
00:36:06,675 --> 00:36:10,179
So you built the torus.

390
00:36:10,679 --> 00:36:15,726
Can you override the servers and place a new president in power?

391
00:36:18,854 --> 00:36:20,689
A coup?

392
00:36:21,774 --> 00:36:23,525
Are you suggesting a coup?

393
00:36:24,026 --> 00:36:25,903
Is it possible?

394
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:31,658
I could write a reboot sequence and shut down the entire system.

395
00:36:31,825 --> 00:36:33,535
And at that point...

396
00:36:37,539 --> 00:36:39,416
Then that is what you will do.

397
00:36:39,583 --> 00:36:43,712
And you will have your contract secured for the next 200 years.

398
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:49,092
Everything we need to protect our liberty.

399
00:36:49,259 --> 00:36:54,264
All guaranteed, of course, by your new president.

400
00:37:02,022 --> 00:37:04,691
You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle.

401
00:37:07,778 --> 00:37:09,738
This is the guy.

402
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:13,742
- This is the guy? - This is him.

403
00:37:14,201 --> 00:37:15,494
Sit down.

404
00:37:17,746 --> 00:37:19,373
We're gonna out you a good one.

405
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,459
Play nice, Sandro. Play nice.

406
00:37:23,252 --> 00:37:25,045
Let's get him an ID first.

407
00:37:25,212 --> 00:37:27,756
Get the chief one of them identification codes.

408
00:37:27,923 --> 00:37:29,174
Get that ready.

409
00:37:29,424 --> 00:37:31,009
Arm up.

410
00:37:36,849 --> 00:37:41,436
That'll merge with the DNA and you'll fit in like you were born there.

411
00:37:43,814 --> 00:37:45,691
Now it's time for the real fun.

412
00:37:51,864 --> 00:37:53,949
Okay. What we got?

413
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,503
Hey, man.

414
00:38:07,337 --> 00:38:10,966
Yo. Is this gonna hurt?

415
00:38:13,135 --> 00:38:16,388
Yeah, bitch, it's gonna hurt. It's gonna hurt good.

416
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:19,808
When we're done with you, you're gonna be a favela ninja.

417
00:38:19,975 --> 00:38:23,896
Marianna, hey, bring down the bone saw.

418
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:30,444
- Bring the bone saw! - This ain't gonna kill me.

419
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:33,614
You're gonna be all right, my brother.

420
00:38:35,073 --> 00:38:36,575
Max.

421
00:38:37,409 --> 00:38:38,827
I'm here.

422
00:38:40,662 --> 00:38:43,665
We got this, man. We got this.

423
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:47,836
Yeah.

424
00:39:41,556 --> 00:39:42,891
Hey!

425
00:39:43,058 --> 00:39:44,309
He's awake!

426
00:39:54,736 --> 00:39:55,946
You can still jack off.

427
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,574
- How's everything going? - He's ready to kick ass.

428
00:40:05,288 --> 00:40:07,374
What the fuck did you do to me?

429
00:40:09,626 --> 00:40:11,086
Gave you a way out.

430
00:41:02,179 --> 00:41:03,388
Damn.

431
00:41:06,683 --> 00:41:10,562
What's up, partner? How's that suit working out for you, man?

432
00:41:12,355 --> 00:41:14,524
That shit is tight.

433
00:41:14,691 --> 00:41:16,318
Show me.

434
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:23,075
Hold that.

435
00:41:24,659 --> 00:41:26,912
What's this, a family heirloom?

436
00:41:27,496 --> 00:41:28,538
Wait for it.

437
00:41:31,083 --> 00:41:34,252
Air-bursting ammunition. Designate your enemy...

438
00:41:34,419 --> 00:41:38,006
and any round you fire will explode around them, five-meter kill radius.

439
00:41:38,924 --> 00:41:40,175
And...

440
00:41:41,176 --> 00:41:44,596
synced detonation rounds for this bad boy.

441
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:46,431
That'll work.

442
00:41:46,598 --> 00:41:48,100
Move out.

443
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,611
Sir?

444
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:01,780
Shuttle is ready.

445
00:42:21,007 --> 00:42:22,300
Do you read me?

446
00:42:27,389 --> 00:42:31,059
Here's the deal. We'll wait outside the factory until we see his shuttle leave.

447
00:42:31,226 --> 00:42:34,980
One of you puts an explosive round in it, goes to the crash site, gets the data.

448
00:42:36,731 --> 00:42:37,732
Okay. Copy that.

449
00:42:42,487 --> 00:42:45,240
Camera's live, boys. You getting this, Spider?

450
00:42:45,407 --> 00:42:47,242
I got it. Let's go. Let's play ball.

451
00:42:47,909 --> 00:42:50,579
- Move out of the way. - Coming through.

452
00:42:57,085 --> 00:42:59,588
- You nervous? - No.

453
00:42:59,754 --> 00:43:00,922
No?

454
00:43:03,258 --> 00:43:05,302
I'm shitting my pants.

455
00:43:35,123 --> 00:43:36,166
GO, go:

456
00:43:51,389 --> 00:43:55,393
Acceleration to supersonic speeds in 15 seconds.

457
00:44:06,154 --> 00:44:07,948
Come on, come OH, come on.

458
00:44:21,002 --> 00:44:24,047
Ma'am, we have an Elysian citizen on Earth in danger.

459
00:44:24,214 --> 00:44:25,674
Data coming up now.

460
00:44:27,467 --> 00:44:30,512
Citizen identified. John Carlyle. N8321P...

461
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:34,474
I see you, motherfucker.

462
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,188
I have a situation here.

463
00:44:42,274 --> 00:44:45,902
Miss Delacourt, how lovely to hear your voice.

464
00:44:46,069 --> 00:44:49,322
There is a citizen carrying sensitive brain data out of the city right now.

465
00:44:49,489 --> 00:44:52,367
- Some thieves are trying to hijack it. - What's in it?

466
00:44:52,534 --> 00:44:53,702
That's classified.

467
00:44:53,868 --> 00:44:56,705
You don't call a recently deactivated agent...

468
00:44:56,871 --> 00:44:59,624
to retrieve classified fucking information, man.

469
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:01,918
The government doesn't know about this, do they?

470
00:45:02,085 --> 00:45:04,546
I can ask for whatever I want, can't I?

471
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:10,635
Please brace for impact.

472
00:45:18,143 --> 00:45:21,062
Please remain calm. You have sustained zero injuries.

473
00:45:21,229 --> 00:45:22,731
Oh, that's a real comfort.

474
00:45:28,069 --> 00:45:31,698
I got one condition. I do this, I get reinstated.

475
00:45:31,865 --> 00:45:36,286
Fine. I've recommissioned two of your preferred agents...

476
00:45:36,453 --> 00:45:38,288
completely confidentially, of course.

477
00:45:38,455 --> 00:45:40,790
They should be at your position any second.

478
00:45:40,957 --> 00:45:42,751
Send me the mission data.

479
00:46:00,393 --> 00:46:02,354
Let's go, guys. Out of the cars.

480
00:46:08,193 --> 00:46:13,531
Droids, there appears to be some type of wheeled vehicle with one...

481
00:46:15,825 --> 00:46:16,951
Two occupants...

482
00:46:17,619 --> 00:46:20,038
and they are armed and I'd like them dead.

483
00:46:23,208 --> 00:46:24,793
Droid!

484
00:46:37,514 --> 00:46:40,183
- No! - Identified. Max Da Costa.

485
00:46:45,855 --> 00:46:47,148
Come on.

486
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:56,324
It's jammed, man!

487
00:46:57,534 --> 00:46:59,077
Got it.

488
00:47:01,788 --> 00:47:03,581
He's reloading!

489
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,978
- You all right? - We gotta go faster. I got the door.

490
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:27,147
Go, go! I got you covered!

491
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:29,524
Go, go, go, go!

492
00:47:40,702 --> 00:47:42,370
Don't fucking move.

493
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,377
- Bring it! - There's another one.

494
00:47:51,921 --> 00:47:53,798
Die, motherfucker!

495
00:47:57,469 --> 00:47:59,053
Don't hit the mark!

496
00:48:52,398 --> 00:48:54,567
No, no, no! No, no! He got hit, he got hit!

497
00:48:54,734 --> 00:48:58,029
Citizen has sustained a cardiothoracic trauma.

498
00:48:58,196 --> 00:48:59,864
Blood pressure is dropping.

499
00:49:00,031 --> 00:49:02,116
It's not in the head. It's in the chest.

500
00:49:02,283 --> 00:49:05,286
We're fucking good, man. Hold his head. Hold his head.

501
00:49:05,787 --> 00:49:08,122
Plug this into you. Come on, get that shit in.

502
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,668
- Come on, baby. - It's in.

503
00:49:13,670 --> 00:49:15,129
Yeah, yeah, we're syncing.

504
00:49:15,296 --> 00:49:19,342
You have no idea what you're doing.

505
00:49:23,054 --> 00:49:24,305
One minute to target, sir.

506
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:31,020
All right. All right, we're synced. Come on, baby, here we go.

507
00:49:32,689 --> 00:49:35,149
It's gonna work. We got it. It's gonna work.

508
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:38,236
It's a data heist, ma'am. They're downloading now.

509
00:49:43,199 --> 00:49:44,742
Guys, we got incoming.

510
00:49:45,743 --> 00:49:46,911
Oh, fuck me.

511
00:49:49,205 --> 00:49:50,707
Come on, guys, hurry up.

512
00:49:50,873 --> 00:49:52,667
That's a Raven. That's military.

513
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:55,253
That's all right, we got this. Ninety-seven, 98.

514
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,297
- Hurry up! They're coming! - Almost there.

515
00:50:03,052 --> 00:50:05,763
Oh, shit. Something must be corrupted.

516
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:09,100
- What the fuck? What does that mean? - Wait. Hold on. Hold on.

517
00:50:09,267 --> 00:50:10,476
I can't read the data.

518
00:50:10,643 --> 00:50:13,396
- It's scrambled. I can't read the data. - What?

519
00:50:15,356 --> 00:50:16,858
Come on, guys, we gotta move!

520
00:50:17,025 --> 00:50:19,527
- What the fuck does "scrambled" mean? - Fuck this.

521
00:50:19,694 --> 00:50:22,614
No, no, no. We have to run it again! Run it another time, man!

522
00:50:22,780 --> 00:50:25,533
Fucking get off me, man. I'm fucking bailing.

523
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,702
Please run it again.

524
00:50:27,869 --> 00:50:30,538
- I can't. Get the fuck off me. - Let's get out of here.

525
00:50:30,705 --> 00:50:32,373
Where the fuck are you going, Sandro?

526
00:50:46,638 --> 00:50:48,222
Come on, Max.

527
00:50:48,389 --> 00:50:50,224
Get out of there! Let's go!

528
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:53,936
We gotta go! Come on, Max. Come on.

529
00:50:56,105 --> 00:50:58,232
Hey, boss. We got a runner.

530
00:50:58,983 --> 00:51:00,568
Locked on.

531
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,403
Fire!

532
00:51:14,666 --> 00:51:15,708
Shit, man.

533
00:51:23,675 --> 00:51:25,176
That's what I'm talking about!

534
00:51:25,343 --> 00:51:26,761
Fuck, man!

535
00:51:26,928 --> 00:51:28,805
Targets moving south-southwest.

536
00:51:28,971 --> 00:51:31,307
Move, Max. It's coming.

537
00:51:35,895 --> 00:51:38,106
We got another one.

538
00:51:38,481 --> 00:51:39,524
Okay.

539
00:51:41,275 --> 00:51:43,111
This is wrong. This is all wrong, man.

540
00:52:33,828 --> 00:52:35,413
Going into a holding pattern, sir.

541
00:52:36,414 --> 00:52:37,999
Where do you think you're going?

542
00:52:40,168 --> 00:52:41,377
Come on!

543
00:53:10,031 --> 00:53:12,366
Fuck! Fucker!

544
00:53:17,330 --> 00:53:18,539
Come on.

545
00:53:19,081 --> 00:53:20,500
No!

546
00:53:59,455 --> 00:54:01,457
No. No.

547
00:54:02,291 --> 00:54:03,501
No.

548
00:54:03,835 --> 00:54:05,336
Get up!

549
00:54:12,844 --> 00:54:14,512
Get up!

550
00:54:23,187 --> 00:54:24,522
No!

551
00:54:43,291 --> 00:54:46,460
We've got one assailant leaving on foot, ma'am.

552
00:54:46,627 --> 00:54:48,671
They have the data. Repeat:

553
00:54:49,130 --> 00:54:52,842
The thieves have the data. Apprehend the target at all costs.

554
00:54:53,009 --> 00:54:55,136
Do not damage his brain.

555
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:57,972
Let's go! We got a runner, boys!

556
00:55:03,144 --> 00:55:07,064
Citizen has suffered catastrophic blood loss leading to cardiac arrest.

557
00:55:07,481 --> 00:55:10,902
Time of death: 1745.

558
00:55:54,862 --> 00:55:58,616
Come on, where are you hiding? What's that?

559
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:10,711
It looks like a herd of pigs, boss.

560
00:56:14,215 --> 00:56:16,884
Take us back to the crash site. See what they left behind.

561
00:56:17,051 --> 00:56:18,052
Roger that.

562
00:56:55,006 --> 00:56:58,926
Hey, boss. I think you'd better come look at this.

563
00:57:00,678 --> 00:57:02,555
This is a record of what we picked up...

564
00:57:02,722 --> 00:57:05,182
in transfer between Carlyle and the criminal, sir.

565
00:57:05,766 --> 00:57:08,185
That's why she wants it so badly.

566
00:57:08,561 --> 00:57:11,772
He's got the keys to the kingdom in his fucking head.

567
00:57:12,648 --> 00:57:14,734
Now we just need to find him.

568
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:18,654
I'm gonna let the girls out.

569
00:57:28,122 --> 00:57:29,957
Searching grids three through 11.

570
00:57:31,667 --> 00:57:34,336
I'm authorizing a full containment order.

571
00:57:37,465 --> 00:57:40,217
- All of Los Angeles? - The murderer is still out there.

572
00:57:40,384 --> 00:57:43,804
Until we apprehend him, no one leaves the surface of that city.

573
00:57:52,146 --> 00:57:53,981
What the...?

574
00:57:58,152 --> 00:57:59,820
Max.

575
00:58:44,865 --> 00:58:46,700
We can go home.

576
00:58:47,409 --> 00:58:49,161
Am I better?

577
00:58:51,163 --> 00:58:54,166
I'm gonna get the car, okay?

578
00:58:57,086 --> 00:58:58,379
Be right back.

579
00:59:03,926 --> 00:59:05,553
Frey....

580
00:59:03,926 --> 00:59:05,553
Frey....

581
00:59:07,596 --> 00:59:08,889
Max.

582
00:59:11,725 --> 00:59:14,436
Oh, my God. What happened to you?

583
00:59:16,522 --> 00:59:19,275
- Shit. Let me get the medics. - No. No.

584
00:59:19,942 --> 00:59:21,485
I can't go in there.

585
00:59:21,652 --> 00:59:24,405
- Max, listen to me. You need a doctor. - I can't go in there. No, no, no.

586
00:59:24,572 --> 00:59:26,699
People are looking for me. They'll kill me.

587
00:59:26,866 --> 00:59:28,868
- I came for you. I need your help. - Max.

588
00:59:29,034 --> 00:59:31,579
You've got to go through the system to get treatment.

589
00:59:38,335 --> 00:59:39,795
Max.

590
00:59:39,962 --> 00:59:41,797
Max.

591
00:59:43,465 --> 00:59:45,092
Stay awake.

592
00:59:54,143 --> 00:59:55,686
I wanna see the man.

593
00:59:56,645 --> 00:59:59,815
Mommy's gonna help him, okay? Try and sleep.

594
01:00:03,986 --> 01:00:05,613
Don't sleep.

595
01:00:10,075 --> 01:00:11,535
Come on.

596
01:00:16,332 --> 01:00:17,541
Stay awake.

597
01:00:17,708 --> 01:00:18,709
Let's turn you over.

598
01:01:05,881 --> 01:01:08,634
Max. Max, wait.

599
01:01:12,471 --> 01:01:13,722
Thank you.

600
01:01:13,889 --> 01:01:15,182
Who did this to you?

601
01:01:15,349 --> 01:01:18,477
Oh, no, I got... I got hurt at work, and I had to...

602
01:01:18,644 --> 01:01:23,649
I had to take a job from Spider to try to get up there and get healed.

603
01:01:23,816 --> 01:01:25,192
It went bad.

604
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:27,403
- I'm in trouble. - Mommy?

605
01:01:38,205 --> 01:01:40,541
Who's that man?

606
01:01:40,958 --> 01:01:45,379
His name is Max. Mommy knew him when he was your age.

607
01:01:46,005 --> 01:01:47,047
This is Matilda.

608
01:01:47,923 --> 01:01:49,550
Hi.

609
01:01:49,717 --> 01:01:54,513
You can go watch cartoons, okay? I'll be right there.

610
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:58,559
I didn't... I didn't know you had...

611
01:01:58,892 --> 01:02:01,895
- I'm so sorry. I need to go. - Wait, Max. Wait.

612
01:02:02,062 --> 01:02:04,273
- Don't leave. Wait. - I shouldn't have come here. I have to leave.

613
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:08,569
Max. She's dying. She's in the final stages of leukemia.

614
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:11,405
I told you my life was complicated.

615
01:02:11,739 --> 01:02:15,868
I need you to help me. I have no idea how to do this.

616
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:18,078
- How to do what? - Get her to Elysium.

617
01:02:18,245 --> 01:02:21,165
- I can't help her. I would... - Max.

618
01:02:21,332 --> 01:02:25,085
- I would if I could. - What about this? Fake citizenship.

619
01:02:25,252 --> 01:02:28,255
If you took her there, could you heal her with this?

620
01:02:28,422 --> 01:02:31,258
It doesn't work that way. This is coded to me.

621
01:02:31,425 --> 01:02:32,926
It's locked to my DNA.

622
01:02:33,093 --> 01:02:34,928
These people who are looking for me...

623
01:02:35,095 --> 01:02:37,639
You don't understand who these people are.

624
01:02:37,806 --> 01:02:40,100
If they find me here, they will kill all of us.

625
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:43,270
The only thing I can do to help you is leave, I promise you.

626
01:02:44,063 --> 01:02:46,774
- She's all I have. - I'm sorry.

627
01:02:52,738 --> 01:02:54,615
You have bandages.

628
01:03:03,457 --> 01:03:06,710
- What are you doing? - I don't want you to be sick.

629
01:03:06,877 --> 01:03:10,297
- Do you wanna hear a story? - No...

630
01:03:11,006 --> 01:03:14,635
There once was a meerkat who lived in the jungle.

631
01:03:14,802 --> 01:03:17,805
He was hungry, but he was small.

632
01:03:17,971 --> 01:03:23,060
So small. And the other big animals had all the food...

633
01:03:23,227 --> 01:03:25,646
because they could reach the fruits.

634
01:03:25,813 --> 01:03:28,816
So he made friends with a hippopotamus to...

635
01:03:28,982 --> 01:03:30,234
Okay, stop.

636
01:03:32,194 --> 01:03:34,530
It doesn't end well for the meerkat.

637
01:03:35,364 --> 01:03:40,828
Yes, it does, because he can stand on the hippopotamus's back...

638
01:03:40,994 --> 01:03:44,248
to get all the fruits that he wants.

639
01:03:44,415 --> 01:03:46,041
What's in it for the hippo?

640
01:03:46,208 --> 01:03:48,335
The hippo wants a friend.

641
01:04:05,227 --> 01:04:06,854
I'm sorry.

642
01:04:45,184 --> 01:04:46,226
Hey, boss.

643
01:04:49,104 --> 01:04:50,564
I think we got him.

644
01:04:56,528 --> 01:04:57,905
Land this fucking craft.

645
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:26,934
- Mommy, is everything okay? - It's okay, sweetie.

646
01:05:36,318 --> 01:05:37,736
Clear.

647
01:05:40,322 --> 01:05:41,657
It's okay, sweetie.

648
01:05:42,658 --> 01:05:44,576
Afternoon.

649
01:05:44,743 --> 01:05:47,120
Sorry to come bursting into your home.

650
01:05:47,287 --> 01:05:50,791
I didn't mean to traumatize your young daughter.

651
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:53,460
Me and the boys here...

652
01:05:53,627 --> 01:05:55,546
we're looking for a young gentleman...

653
01:05:55,712 --> 01:05:58,006
who was in this very house a moment ago.

654
01:05:58,507 --> 01:06:01,343
We're hoping you can tell us where he went.

655
01:06:01,510 --> 01:06:05,556
No. I...

656
01:06:07,349 --> 01:06:08,976
I don't know where he is.

657
01:06:09,601 --> 01:06:14,398
I don't believe in committing violent acts in front of kids...

658
01:06:14,565 --> 01:06:16,984
so I just need you to close your eyes, sweetheart.

659
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:19,111
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

660
01:06:19,278 --> 01:06:22,072
I really need you to tell me.

661
01:06:22,239 --> 01:06:24,908
Where is he? You remember now?

662
01:06:25,075 --> 01:06:26,493
- Mommy. - Close your eyes.

663
01:06:26,660 --> 01:06:29,121
Keep your fucking eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed.

664
01:06:29,288 --> 01:06:30,831
Please, I don't know where he is.

665
01:06:30,998 --> 01:06:34,876
He was wounded. I helped him and he left.

666
01:06:35,043 --> 01:06:36,336
Please.

667
01:06:36,503 --> 01:06:39,673
Do you fucking hate that? No loyalty nowadays, eh?

668
01:06:42,718 --> 01:06:44,052
It's okay, sweetie.

669
01:06:44,219 --> 01:06:48,015
And what's this here? This a hospital you running here? What's going on?

670
01:06:48,181 --> 01:06:51,101
- She's sick. - She's sick?

671
01:06:51,476 --> 01:06:53,270
She's sick? Let me have a look at her.

672
01:06:54,438 --> 01:06:57,691
- Don't touch her. - See that? Protective instinct there, eh?

673
01:06:57,858 --> 01:06:59,109
I said don't touch her!

674
01:06:59,276 --> 01:07:03,363
I'm trying to get a word with your child. If you give me a second. Bring her. Come.

675
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,074
- Where are you taking us? - I've got something you want.

676
01:07:06,241 --> 01:07:07,326
- It's okay. - Mommy.

677
01:07:07,492 --> 01:07:09,202
It's okay, sweetie. It's okay.

678
01:07:09,369 --> 01:07:10,621
Sit down. Shut up.

679
01:07:25,761 --> 01:07:26,928
Stop.

680
01:07:28,221 --> 01:07:30,057
Hey, hey, hey

681
01:07:30,515 --> 01:07:33,060
No, no, no. Don't shoot him, don't shoot him.

682
01:07:33,226 --> 01:07:35,103
Put the guns down. Let him come.

683
01:07:36,021 --> 01:07:38,899
- You got something, didn't you? - What?

684
01:07:39,066 --> 01:07:42,736
That's why they shut down the sky. Come on. What is it? Wire transfers?

685
01:07:42,903 --> 01:07:45,030
Corporate intel? You gotta have something big.

686
01:07:45,197 --> 01:07:46,490
I fucking got nothing, man.

687
01:07:46,657 --> 01:07:50,077
It all got scrambled. Julio is dead. You owe me.

688
01:07:50,243 --> 01:07:52,245
- Let's go fucking now! - We can't!

689
01:07:52,412 --> 01:07:54,665
The flight system is jammed!

690
01:07:54,831 --> 01:07:56,583
Nobody is going up there.

691
01:08:00,212 --> 01:08:02,255
- Till when? - Till I don't fucking know.

692
01:08:02,964 --> 01:08:06,301
- I gotta get up there, man. - Oh, everyone needs to get up there.

693
01:08:06,468 --> 01:08:08,970
My guys are working to see if we have a hope in hell...

694
01:08:09,137 --> 01:08:12,265
which I personally think we do not, of ever getting back online.

695
01:08:12,432 --> 01:08:15,102
But for now...

696
01:08:15,310 --> 01:08:17,938
let's just take a look at that head of yours.

697
01:08:18,105 --> 01:08:21,274
- Get away from me, man. - Just look at me.

698
01:08:21,441 --> 01:08:27,280
If they shut down the whole fucking sky for what's in your head...

699
01:08:27,614 --> 01:08:32,119
maybe the key to opening it could be in there too, right?

700
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,163
Come on.

701
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:41,670
All right.

702
01:08:50,429 --> 01:08:54,641
They will hunt you to the edge of the Earth for this.

703
01:08:54,808 --> 01:08:56,226
What is it?

704
01:08:56,393 --> 01:08:58,979
It's a reboot program for Elysium.

705
01:08:59,146 --> 01:09:03,859
Whoever has this has the power to override their whole system.

706
01:09:04,526 --> 01:09:06,737
Open the borders.

707
01:09:06,903 --> 01:09:10,907
Make everyone a citizen of Elysium.

708
01:09:12,868 --> 01:09:17,289
This can save your life.

709
01:09:18,206 --> 01:09:20,667
We can save everyone.

710
01:09:20,834 --> 01:09:22,002
When can I go?

711
01:09:22,169 --> 01:09:24,755
They're trying to hack through the signal jam, but soon.

712
01:09:24,921 --> 01:09:29,342
- Don't bullshit me. When can we go? - I don't know. Five days.

713
01:09:29,509 --> 01:09:32,012
Fuck you. I don't have five days.

714
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:34,097
- I got hours. - My guys are working on it.

715
01:09:34,264 --> 01:09:37,601
You're always working on it man. You don't... You can't get me up there.

716
01:09:37,768 --> 01:09:40,854
I don't know even why do you even try sending people up there man. They just get fucking shot down.

717
01:09:41,021 --> 01:09:43,523
Not with what's in your head! That's what I'm talking about.

718
01:09:43,690 --> 01:09:46,943
We would control the system here. We would be in charge.

719
01:09:47,110 --> 01:09:49,529
We can change the course of fucking history here.

720
01:09:49,696 --> 01:09:51,031
Back up, then.

721
01:09:51,198 --> 01:09:55,452
What I have in my head is worth a lot to them, right?

722
01:09:56,995 --> 01:09:58,455
Don't do this.

723
01:09:58,622 --> 01:10:02,292
If that falls into the wrong hands, they could shut us out for good.

724
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:05,378
Listen, man, I'm going up there right now.

725
01:10:05,796 --> 01:10:10,050
Now, if you can find me and I'm healed, you can have all of this.

726
01:10:10,217 --> 01:10:13,136
- But I'm not fucking dying. - This is wrong, Max. Don't do this.

727
01:10:24,731 --> 01:10:26,483
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

728
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,610
Don't shoot him. Don't shoot him.

729
01:10:40,330 --> 01:10:42,833
I always wanted a wife.

730
01:10:46,545 --> 01:10:49,130
I just couldn't quite settle down, you know.

731
01:10:49,297 --> 01:10:52,050
Too much temptation.

732
01:10:55,053 --> 01:10:57,055
But you...

733
01:11:01,977 --> 01:11:04,563
You make me ready to settle down.

734
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:07,190
You really make me wanna settle down, baby.

735
01:11:19,327 --> 01:11:21,204
- Holy shit, sir. - Eh?

736
01:11:21,538 --> 01:11:23,999
- You better take a look at this. - What? What is it?

737
01:11:24,207 --> 01:11:26,459
Check this fucking oke.

738
01:11:29,421 --> 01:11:30,714
Turn us around.

739
01:11:55,947 --> 01:11:57,407
- Drakey? - Yes?

740
01:11:57,574 --> 01:11:58,867
Open the door.

741
01:12:11,379 --> 01:12:12,672
Stop right there!

742
01:12:12,839 --> 01:12:17,177
You're gonna do exactly what I say or I'm gonna blow my fucking head off!

743
01:12:21,139 --> 01:12:23,183
You can have everything in my head!

744
01:12:23,725 --> 01:12:26,686
Just take me up there and get me in a med bay!

745
01:12:27,228 --> 01:12:29,356
What I have is very valuable!

746
01:12:29,522 --> 01:12:31,733
We can fix you up.

747
01:12:32,067 --> 01:12:34,986
Put you in a med bay, sort all this kak up.

748
01:12:35,362 --> 01:12:38,949
Let's go. We'll take you up there.

749
01:12:39,115 --> 01:12:42,118
Weather's nice. Air's nice and clean.

750
01:12:45,664 --> 01:12:47,457
Don't you fucking try anything.

751
01:12:47,666 --> 01:12:51,586
Step aboard. Come meet the boys. Come, boet.

752
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:54,214
Don't be shy. They won't bite.

753
01:12:54,381 --> 01:12:56,925
Let me introduce you. This is Drakey.

754
01:12:57,092 --> 01:12:59,427
- This is Max. - How is it, butch?

755
01:12:59,678 --> 01:13:01,554
Close up, Drakey.

756
01:13:01,721 --> 01:13:03,515
Copy that.

757
01:13:10,105 --> 01:13:11,898
Crowe, let's go.

758
01:13:14,317 --> 01:13:18,989
Yes, ma'am. We apprehended the subject.

759
01:13:19,155 --> 01:13:21,157
Open the skies, we're coming home.

760
01:13:37,132 --> 01:13:39,092
Cancel the no-fly zone.

761
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:40,927
Yes, ma'am.

762
01:13:42,804 --> 01:13:44,389
What? What?

763
01:13:45,015 --> 01:13:47,559
What is that? What is that? Are we back?

764
01:13:47,726 --> 01:13:51,104
- What the fuck is that? Are we back? - We're back online, Spider.

765
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,492
Frey.

766
01:14:03,450 --> 01:14:04,492
Frey.

767
01:14:05,994 --> 01:14:08,705
I'm sorry. I'm gonna make this right.

768
01:14:20,592 --> 01:14:21,968
We've got him.

769
01:14:22,135 --> 01:14:23,344
All right. Where is he?

770
01:14:23,511 --> 01:14:27,015
He's leaving Earth, heading to Elysium.

771
01:14:32,854 --> 01:14:37,442
Manuel, Rico. Get weapons. Let's get up there.

772
01:14:43,865 --> 01:14:47,243
Echo Leader 234 requesting landing in Sector 22.

773
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:50,497
Roger that, Echo Leader M-234. You are cleared for entry.

774
01:15:48,096 --> 01:15:51,891
- I see you got the G-19. - Hey, back the fuck up. Back the fuck up.

775
01:15:52,058 --> 01:15:53,268
- Or what? - I'll let it go.

776
01:15:55,061 --> 01:15:57,397
I want what's in your head, boykie.

777
01:15:58,314 --> 01:15:59,816
Come on. Come on.

778
01:15:59,983 --> 01:16:01,776
Legs! Grab his legs!

779
01:16:10,326 --> 01:16:11,953
Grab the grenade!

780
01:16:12,120 --> 01:16:13,621
Hold on!

781
01:16:19,252 --> 01:16:20,461
Get down!

782
01:17:01,127 --> 01:17:03,296
- What do you want us to do? - I want everyone...

783
01:17:03,463 --> 01:17:06,424
coming out of that vehicle apprehended by Homeland Security.

784
01:17:06,591 --> 01:17:09,969
Evacuate everyone under Level 5 clearance out of the building now.

785
01:17:17,602 --> 01:17:18,811
Matilda!

786
01:17:18,978 --> 01:17:20,521
I warned you of this.

787
01:17:20,688 --> 01:17:23,983
An unlicensed vehicle just crashed, potentially threatening the torus.

788
01:17:24,150 --> 01:17:28,279
All because of your inability to act. Evacuate him.

789
01:17:29,072 --> 01:17:32,659
- Get your hands off of me. - This is an act of war.

790
01:17:32,825 --> 01:17:35,703
That puts the CCB under my control.

791
01:17:38,331 --> 01:17:41,834
I'm sure you have a fundraiser to attend.

792
01:17:42,001 --> 01:17:43,503
Let's go, sir.

793
01:17:49,884 --> 01:17:51,886
Why are you not answering me?

794
01:17:56,266 --> 01:17:57,558
Max.

795
01:17:57,725 --> 01:18:01,896
- Take me out of here, Max! - Yeah. I'm trying!

796
01:18:02,772 --> 01:18:05,275
Air quality reaching toxic levels.

797
01:18:11,531 --> 01:18:12,865
Get me out of here.

798
01:18:13,741 --> 01:18:16,452
It is recommended you exit the craft immediately.

799
01:18:28,339 --> 01:18:30,049
- Run! - Come here, you fucker.

800
01:18:46,149 --> 01:18:48,776
Two illegals heading northeast in Zone 3.

801
01:18:57,118 --> 01:19:00,246
You deal with those two. I'll handle this poes.

802
01:19:00,663 --> 01:19:04,834
Welcome to this spectacular property, sprawling over...

803
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,222
Error.

804
01:19:18,973 --> 01:19:22,352
- No. - No citizen detected.

805
01:19:24,562 --> 01:19:29,275
Please. She's sick. Help us. She's gone into a coma. Please.

806
01:19:54,550 --> 01:19:57,637
Shouldn't we remove this thing?

807
01:19:57,804 --> 01:20:02,100
Can't, till we get all the data. It's wired into him neurologically.

808
01:20:02,266 --> 01:20:03,935
The data is intact, yes?

809
01:20:05,228 --> 01:20:06,354
Data looks intact.

810
01:20:06,979 --> 01:20:08,022
Warning.

811
01:20:08,189 --> 01:20:10,900
We can still pull the data out of him, which will kill him.

812
01:20:11,067 --> 01:20:15,530
Oh, that's fine. How long before you can download and turn the system online?

813
01:20:15,696 --> 01:20:16,989
Not long, ma'am.

814
01:20:17,156 --> 01:20:20,660
Keep everything in a restricted cloud. Lock down all access.

815
01:20:20,827 --> 01:20:21,994
Starting prep right now.

816
01:20:24,497 --> 01:20:27,500
And get these two out of here.

817
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:29,335
Roger that.

818
01:20:29,502 --> 01:20:32,338
Crowe, you wanna go get the boss's chicks?

819
01:20:32,505 --> 01:20:34,340
Yeah, boet.

820
01:20:59,282 --> 01:21:02,869
Give them the runaround. Keep them busy.

821
01:21:06,622 --> 01:21:07,832
Got him.

822
01:21:08,291 --> 01:21:09,375
Let's go.

823
01:21:09,542 --> 01:21:12,795
All right, 50 exabytes, buddy. You ready?

824
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:15,840
What are you taking out of him?

825
01:21:16,007 --> 01:21:19,218
Hey. What are you doing to him?

826
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:21,429
What's gonna happen to him? Hey.

827
01:21:23,306 --> 01:21:24,390
Rise and shine.

828
01:21:25,516 --> 01:21:26,559
- Get up. - Max.

829
01:21:27,351 --> 01:21:29,145
Max. Max!

830
01:21:29,312 --> 01:21:31,063
Max!

831
01:21:44,827 --> 01:21:46,579
Get in there.

832
01:21:51,459 --> 01:21:53,252
Away.

833
01:21:51,459 --> 01:21:53,252
Xa.

834
01:21:57,465 --> 01:21:58,508
Boss got fucked up, eh?

835
01:21:58,674 --> 01:22:00,801
Ate that fucking grenade, eh?

836
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:07,975
His brain is fine, but he's gonna be pissed when he wakes up, eh?

837
01:22:08,142 --> 01:22:11,437
Remember the kak that happened in India when he lost his legs.

838
01:22:34,961 --> 01:22:36,546
Kruger.

839
01:22:38,839 --> 01:22:40,675
Hey, boss.

840
01:22:42,051 --> 01:22:44,095
It's Crowe.

841
01:22:46,639 --> 01:22:49,183
Where is he?

842
01:22:50,601 --> 01:22:51,769
All right. We're all set.

843
01:22:51,936 --> 01:22:54,105
Okay. Let's re-sedate him.

844
01:22:54,730 --> 01:22:58,025
Got the needle prepped. Here, you wanna grab this and then...

845
01:22:58,192 --> 01:23:00,820
Grab the needle! Grab the needle! Stick him with it!

846
01:23:21,173 --> 01:23:23,509
- Where did they take the girls? - The armory.

847
01:23:23,843 --> 01:23:27,888
- Where the fuck is that? - Level three.

848
01:23:34,770 --> 01:23:37,648
Lethal radiation poisoning detected.

849
01:23:47,825 --> 01:23:51,454
You idiot. Do you realize what you've done?

850
01:23:51,621 --> 01:23:56,125
You crashed an unlicensed vehicle into a suburban area.

851
01:23:57,710 --> 01:24:01,380
Your orders were to keep this covert.

852
01:24:01,547 --> 01:24:04,759
Do you even remember what that means?

853
01:24:07,136 --> 01:24:09,722
Have you completely lost your mind?

854
01:24:09,889 --> 01:24:11,390
You're useless to me.

855
01:24:11,557 --> 01:24:14,393
If the administration realized what we're doing...

856
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,854
they'd hang us both for treason.

857
01:24:23,277 --> 01:24:25,404
Yes.

858
01:24:26,656 --> 01:24:28,574
Yes, ma'am...

859
01:24:29,325 --> 01:24:30,576
I'm listening.

860
01:24:32,620 --> 01:24:37,416
I'm sorry that we crashed the vehicle and ruined someone's lawn.

861
01:24:37,583 --> 01:24:40,169
But nobody is gonna hang us for treason.

862
01:24:41,337 --> 01:24:42,421
We do the hanging.

863
01:24:45,174 --> 01:24:48,469
Put your hand on it. Keep pressure on it.

864
01:24:49,178 --> 01:24:51,222
Not so chirpy now, eh?

865
01:24:51,389 --> 01:24:55,768
It's all right, boys. Elysium is about to get its first proper president.

866
01:25:00,314 --> 01:25:02,817
She needs some medical attention.

867
01:25:08,989 --> 01:25:10,950
I was gonna heal your daughter.

868
01:25:11,117 --> 01:25:14,495
But now I will make sure that she is never healed.

869
01:25:15,621 --> 01:25:18,290
Drakey, don't trust any of these politicians.

870
01:25:18,457 --> 01:25:22,378
- You clear out this whole building. - Thank you, boss.

871
01:25:22,545 --> 01:25:25,965
I'm gonna find that little gangster and I'm gonna take what's in his head.

872
01:25:26,340 --> 01:25:28,509
This place is mine now.

873
01:25:28,676 --> 01:25:31,971
You wanna come to my fucking house and play? Let's play.

874
01:25:32,138 --> 01:25:35,349
I'm going to annihilate that little motherfucker.

875
01:25:35,516 --> 01:25:37,977
I'm going to pulverize that little one.

876
01:25:42,773 --> 01:25:43,983
Hey!

877
01:25:52,533 --> 01:25:53,576
What the hell was that?

No.

881
01:26:14,555 --> 01:26:16,432
No more.

882
01:26:21,937 --> 01:26:23,856
Citizen deceased.

883
01:26:34,366 --> 01:26:39,872
Please exercise caution. Illegals detected in multiple locations.

884
01:26:40,039 --> 01:26:45,586
Emergency systems are now online. Please follow indicated procedures.

885
01:26:46,462 --> 01:26:49,715
Spider. Do you read me, Spider?

886
01:26:49,882 --> 01:26:51,050
Max, where are you?

887
01:26:51,217 --> 01:26:54,386
The thing in my head, it can make everyone a citizen here, right?

888
01:26:55,888 --> 01:26:58,891
- Yeah. - You know how to get it out, right?

889
01:27:01,143 --> 01:27:02,728
Yeah, I'm sure.

890
01:27:02,895 --> 01:27:04,104
Okay, listen carefully.

891
01:27:12,154 --> 01:27:13,989
Armory selected.

892
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:29,004
Set.

893
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:35,135
Turn me on.

894
01:27:40,266 --> 01:27:41,308
Okay.

895
01:27:42,518 --> 01:27:47,189
- Crowe, get rid of those two. - My pleasure, boss. My pleasure.

896
01:27:47,815 --> 01:27:49,525
Where are you, boykie? Where are you?

897
01:28:08,377 --> 01:28:10,379
How is it, girl?

898
01:28:11,797 --> 01:28:13,507
- Let's play. - No.

899
01:28:13,674 --> 01:28:16,385
- Come on. I'll be nice, I promise. - No, please.

900
01:28:17,219 --> 01:28:18,345
- Come on. - Get off me.

901
01:28:18,512 --> 01:28:19,930
- Want me to hurt the girl? - No.

902
01:28:20,097 --> 01:28:21,557
- Then come here. - Please.

903
01:28:51,837 --> 01:28:53,172
Oh, fuck!

904
01:28:57,092 --> 01:28:59,053
You fucker!

905
01:29:05,267 --> 01:29:07,269
The only way out of here is through me.

906
01:29:32,127 --> 01:29:34,380
- Is she alive? - For now.

907
01:29:34,546 --> 01:29:36,131
Stay behind me.

908
01:29:38,133 --> 01:29:40,052
I'm gonna get you out of here.

909
01:29:40,219 --> 01:29:41,929
I have a plan.

910
01:29:46,892 --> 01:29:50,229
You hear that sound? That's the sound of me coming for you.

911
01:29:52,314 --> 01:29:54,733
I will find you! I will hunt you down!

912
01:29:56,902 --> 01:29:59,154
- Okay, Frey, we have to split up. - What?

913
01:29:59,321 --> 01:30:02,116
Listen. You're gonna go to the surface, okay? Take this.

914
01:30:02,282 --> 01:30:04,618
All right. Find a house. Get her to a med bay.

915
01:30:04,785 --> 01:30:06,662
- It won't work. - Don't stop for anybody.

916
01:30:06,829 --> 01:30:11,959
- She doesn't have an ID. It doesn't work. - It will this time. I know how to fix it.

917
01:30:12,418 --> 01:30:13,627
- Surface selected. - Go.

918
01:30:13,794 --> 01:30:16,296
- Come with me. - I'm right behind you.

919
01:30:16,463 --> 01:30:18,590
- No. - I promise.

920
01:30:37,443 --> 01:30:42,114
Okay. A mother and a daughter just went up in that elevator right there.

921
01:30:42,281 --> 01:30:44,616
They're going to the surface, headed for a med bay.

922
01:30:44,783 --> 01:30:48,662
Send one of your guys, make sure they get there, and we have our deal.

923
01:30:48,829 --> 01:30:49,872
All right.

924
01:30:50,789 --> 01:30:52,833
Right to a med bay, man.

925
01:31:00,507 --> 01:31:03,177
- Go, go, go. - This way. Come on.

926
01:31:03,469 --> 01:31:05,637
- Come on. This way. - Hurry up, man.

927
01:31:06,722 --> 01:31:09,475
Emergency lockdown initiated.

928
01:31:11,185 --> 01:31:12,811
Almost there. Almost there.

929
01:31:19,902 --> 01:31:22,029
Pull it out! It's just a flesh wound, boet.

930
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:34,333
That's what I'm talking about.

931
01:31:39,088 --> 01:31:42,382
- Fire has been detected. All affected... - Open the door. Open the door.

932
01:31:42,549 --> 01:31:44,593
Areas will be shut down.

933
01:31:46,345 --> 01:31:48,472
- Come on, come on. - I got it. Go, go, go.

934
01:31:51,308 --> 01:31:52,351
Let's go.

935
01:31:55,604 --> 01:31:58,857
Fucking door, come on. Go. You first, come on.

936
01:31:59,024 --> 01:32:00,901
Emergency lockdown initiated.

937
01:32:01,235 --> 01:32:03,529
- Please stand clear of all exits. - Come on.

938
01:32:10,119 --> 01:32:12,371
Get up. Get up. Come on, let's go. Stand up.

939
01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:15,457
Come on. Stand up. Stand up. Come on.

940
01:32:19,461 --> 01:32:20,629
Come on. Stand up.

941
01:32:21,004 --> 01:32:22,422
Hey

942
01:32:30,264 --> 01:32:32,057
You little fucker.

943
01:32:32,474 --> 01:32:35,227
I'm gonna take your fucking head off.

944
01:32:35,394 --> 01:32:37,312
You should definitely stand up now!

945
01:33:01,336 --> 01:33:02,963
Stay there.

946
01:33:08,552 --> 01:33:09,803
Fuck.

947
01:33:16,143 --> 01:33:17,519
Okay.

948
01:33:36,121 --> 01:33:39,458
- You think you can get through me? - Come on, Max! Come on!

949
01:34:10,030 --> 01:34:11,073
Come on.

950
01:34:12,741 --> 01:34:14,493
Don't give up now. Get up. Come.

951
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:17,913
Come on, you've got more than that. I know you.

952
01:34:18,330 --> 01:34:20,332
You look a little bit dizzy, eh?

953
01:34:22,751 --> 01:34:26,338
Did I get you? Are you bleeding? You must get that looked at.

954
01:34:26,505 --> 01:34:27,923
Eh, boykie?

955
01:34:41,270 --> 01:34:43,188
You wanna heal that little girl?

956
01:34:43,355 --> 01:34:45,983
You just need to come through me.

957
01:35:21,018 --> 01:35:22,811
You almost had me.

958
01:35:36,241 --> 01:35:37,909
Okay. Okay.

959
01:35:38,827 --> 01:35:40,579
Okay. Come on, man. Let's go.

960
01:35:59,723 --> 01:36:01,767
Okay. Let's go.

961
01:36:05,812 --> 01:36:07,356
Get the door!

962
01:36:13,362 --> 01:36:14,613
Come on.

963
01:36:15,447 --> 01:36:18,116
All right. Let's do it.

964
01:36:38,136 --> 01:36:39,638
All right.

965
01:36:47,813 --> 01:36:48,855
What?

966
01:36:52,818 --> 01:36:54,111
Max?

967
01:36:54,277 --> 01:36:56,321
It's okay. I know.

968
01:36:57,531 --> 01:36:59,324
There's no coming back from this.

969
01:37:00,242 --> 01:37:01,910
No med bay can heal you.

970
01:37:16,133 --> 01:37:17,759
All right. Give it to me.

971
01:37:20,679 --> 01:37:22,055
Take it.

972
01:37:23,807 --> 01:37:27,686
Okay. You just have to press that button.

973
01:37:31,773 --> 01:37:33,191
Frey.

974
01:37:31,773 --> 01:37:33,191
Frey.

975
01:37:37,529 --> 01:37:39,448
I'm gonna have to break my promise.

976
01:37:39,656 --> 01:37:42,284
I can't make it back up there.

977
01:37:43,827 --> 01:37:45,787
You remember what I said when we were kids?

978
01:37:45,954 --> 01:37:47,038
Yes.

979
01:37:48,248 --> 01:37:50,709
- I'll take us there one day. - Really?

980
01:37:50,876 --> 01:37:52,085
Yeah, I promise.

981
01:38:02,637 --> 01:38:04,723
You wouldn't believe what I'm looking at now.

982
01:38:12,647 --> 01:38:15,484
Tell Matilda I really liked her story.

983
01:38:15,650 --> 01:38:17,027
And I...

984
01:38:19,613 --> 01:38:21,615
I figured out why the hippo did it.

985
01:38:49,601 --> 01:38:51,144
Come on.

986
01:38:52,395 --> 01:38:54,105
You first. Come on.

987
01:38:54,606 --> 01:38:57,275
Everyone has one special thing, Max.

988
01:38:58,360 --> 01:39:00,445
One thing that they are destined to do.

989
01:39:01,404 --> 01:39:03,657
One thing they were born for.

990
01:39:19,506 --> 01:39:21,299
Let go of me.

991
01:39:35,146 --> 01:39:36,481
Come on.

992
01:39:59,004 --> 01:40:00,839
Hey, Chiquita.

993
01:40:07,345 --> 01:40:08,680
Hey-

994
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:14,352
Stand down, officers.

995
01:40:21,776 --> 01:40:25,864
- Arrest him! - I cannot arrest a citizen of Elysium.

996
01:40:27,532 --> 01:40:30,243
- What? - You did a great job.

997
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:34,039
Guess who Elysium belongs to now.

998
01:41:29,678 --> 01:41:32,472
You see how beautiful it looks to us from here?

999
01:41:33,014 --> 01:41:36,142
Now look how beautiful we look from there.

1000
01:41:36,434 --> 01:41:38,144
This is yours now.

1001
01:41:39,062 --> 01:41:42,774
To never forget about where you come from.

1002
01:41:55,203 --> 01:41:56,830
My little Max.

1003
